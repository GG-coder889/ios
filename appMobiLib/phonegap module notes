1. download latest phonegap release from http://www.phonegap.com/download (last used: http://phonegap.googlecode.com/files/phonegap-0.9.1.zip)
2. check README.md in phonegap/phonegap-iphone for instruction on building PhoneGapLib
	a. for 0.9.1, do 'make' in phonegap/phonegap-iphone/PhoneGapLib; this builds phonegap/phonegap-iphone/PhoneGapLib/javascripts/phonegap.js
3. get phonegap.js from output location, copy into Slimfit project folder
4. copy all classes from phonegap/phonegap-iphone/PhoneGapLib/Classes into Slimfit (not all are needed, cleanup later)
	a. PhonegapDelegate, PhoneGapViewController are not used?
5. in 0.9.1 Sound.m needed to be changed to not refer to www directory which only exists in phonegap
 TODO: finish fixing Sound to support www from bundle
 
 To do:
 add phonegap version to plist, update device to read from plist
 fix sound as above
